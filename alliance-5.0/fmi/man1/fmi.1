\- FSM state miminization

.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
\fBfmi\fP [\fI-V\fP] \fIinput_file\fP  \fIoutput_file\fP
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.br
Made to run on FSM descriptions, \fBfmi\fP supports the same subset of VHDL as syf 
(for further informations about this subset see SYF(1) and FSM(5)).
\fBfmi\fP uses a Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams representation and 
identifies equivalent states.
After this step, it drives a new FSM where all equivalent states are replaced
by a single state.
.br
As a restriction \fBfmi\fP doesn't handle don't cares (as this much more
difficult).

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.br
.HP
.ti 7
\fIMBK_WORK_LIB\fP gives the path of the FSM description.
The default value is the current directory.
.br
.HP
.ti 7
\fIMBK_CATA_LIB\fP gives some auxiliary pathes for the FSM descriptions.
The default value is the current directory.
.SH OPTIONS
.ti 7
\-V
Sets verbose mode on. Each step of the minimization is displayed on the
standard output.
