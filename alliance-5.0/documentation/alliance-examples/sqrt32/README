This directory contains the VHDL description of combinatorial 32 bits
sqrt chip and the associated stimuli file, and also a configuration file for IO
placement (used during the Place and Route step).

The Makefile set environement variables properly and run Alliance tools, 
following each step of the design flow from VHDL up to real layout in a
 pseudo 0.35 techno.

 
copy the folder "sqrt32" to any writable folder of your choice and type:
$ make
